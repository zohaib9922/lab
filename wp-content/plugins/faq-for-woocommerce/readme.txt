## 🤖 SCHEMA SUPPORT ##

Increasing search engine visibility is one of the best ways to grow your business. The better ranking you have, the more traffic you will get from the search engines. If you want to rank your product page, then you must use the FAQ schema.

You can enable FAQ schema by navigating **XPlainer > Settings > Schema**. By default, FAQ schema is enabled in this WooCommerce product FAQ plugin. It is recommended to keep it enabled to amplify your product page SEO.

## 🔀 SORTING FAQS ##

The XPlainer WooCommerce FAQ plugin works in a more advanced way than the other FAQ accordion plugins. This FAQ sorting feature might be a great example to support this statement.

XPlainer allows the users to sort the FAQs under different parameters like ‘**order**’ and ‘**order_by**’. You can also implement this sorting feature by using shortcodes. Check the following feature to learn about using the shortcode feature.

## 🚀 SHORTCODE SUPPORT ##

A smart representation of WooCommerce product FAQs impacts sales directly. That’s why you must display the product FAQs wherever needed. That’s why this WordPress FAQ plugin comes with the shortcode feature.


ℹ️ You can display **all FAQs** for a random product having FAQs with the default template:

`
[ffw_template]
`

ℹ️ To **display all FAQs for a specific product**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template id=20]
`

💡 Here, 20 is the product id. Replace it with your desired product id.

ℹ️ To **display FAQs for specific FAQ categories**, use the following shortcode:

`
[ffw_template cat_ids="32, 33"]
`

💡 If the cat_ids exist, then the product id will be ignored. Here 32 & 33 are FAQ categories id. Please use the comma separator while inputting the data.

If you want to sort the product FAQs using shortcodes, you can do it by using ‘order’ and ‘order_by’ parameters.

The supported values for ‘order’ (Default Value: ‘ASC’)
– ‘DESC’, ‘ASC’

The supported values for ‘order_by’ (Default Value: ‘ID’)
– ‘ID’, ‘date’, ‘title’, ‘name’, ‘date’, ‘modified’, ‘comment_count’, ‘author’.

ℹ️ Use the shortcode below to display FAQs for a current product id (for the single product page):

`
[ffw_template dynamic_post=true]
`

💡 This shortcode is appropriate for single product pages.

ℹ️ Use the following shortcode to display all FAQs for a specific product with a specific template by this easy accordion FAQ plugin.

`
[ffw_template template=1 id=20]
`

💡 Use the following template ids to show FAQs

* For Classic Template – 1
* For Whitish Template – 2
* For Trip Template – 3
* For Pop Template – 4

## 🔎 CUSTOM STYLE SUPPORT ##

To design the product FAQs even better, the XPlainer WooCommerce FAQ plugin comes with custom styling support. By implementing this feature, you can control lots of parameters. Here is the list of those -

* FAQ wrapper width
* Question text color
* Question background color
* Question background Secondary color (applicable for pop layout)
* Question border color
* Question font size
* Answer text color
* Answer background color
* Answer border color &
* Custom CSS

💡 The **custom CSS** is the most prioritized CSS. Adding custom CSS will override the default styling.

## 🎯 FULLY RESPONSIVE ##

Like the FAQ schema, the responsiveness of a website doesn't affect only the website’s ranking on the search engines. Besides that, it improves the user experience too. Fortunately, this XPlainer FAQ accordion plugin is compatible with almost all third-party themes.

Hence, this FAQ WordPress plugin can display the questions and answers on every product page by maintaining responsiveness. So, no more worrying about presenting the product information on multiple devices. XPlainer FAQ plugin will maintain your website's responsiveness on every page.

## 🎦 MEDIA/IMAGE SUPPORT IN FAQ ANSWER ##

A picture is worth a thousand words. While answering the questions, you might need to use some images or videos to explain the answer better. To help you in this situation, XPlainer allows the insertion of digital media in the answers.

It not only helps to answer the questions better but also answers them more appropriately. You can insert every media file that is supported by WordPress.

## 🔁 ADDING CONTENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE FAQ LIST ##

The XPlainer FAQ plugin doesn't only add FAQ questions and answers. Besides that, you can also add a heading and footer within the FAQ wrapper. You can update these contents by navigating to **XPlainer > Settings page**. Then select the **General** tab and scroll down. The WYSIWYG text editor for adding content before and after the FAQs is at the bottom of the **General** tab.

Both the Before FAQ and After FAQ has the WYSIWYG HTML editor. So, you can use heading, normal texts, or media files as the header or footer on the FAQ tab. Once you change these contents, those will be automatically applied to all product pages.

## 📝 HTML CONTENT ##

XPlainer not only supports the WYSIWYG editor for answering the questions and answers. Moreover, you can write your answers in HTML. As it supports the WP editor, so you can write your answers in both plain text and HTML. It gives the freedom to present the customer’s queries smartly and professionally.

## 🎢 MULTIPLE LAYOUTS – STANDARD TEMPLATES FOR FRONT VIEW ##

This WooCommerce Product FAQ has four built-in templates to choose from. These are -

  * Classic Template

Increase or decrease the value by 10 to change the tab’s position. For example, if you want to display the FAQs as the first tab, the value will be 10. Just like that, the value will be 20 for the 2nd position or 50 for the 5th position.

## 🎬 SHOW/HIDE FAQ ANSWERS ON PAGE LOAD ##

By default, the product FAQs are listed just like a simple FAQ accordion style. If you want to read the answer to a specific question, you have to click on that question, and it will show the answer.

But, XPlainer is designed to offer something extra than others. So, you can set whether you want to show or hide the answers while the product page loads initially.

To do that, go to **XPlainer > Settings** page and then find the **Display All Answers** option under the **General** tab. You can choose to either show or hide the answers from here. After choosing your preferred method, click on the **Save Changes** button, and it will be set for the whole website.

## 👨‍💻 OPTION TO EXPAND/COLLAPSE ALL FAQS ##

Besides controlling the FAQs visibility from the dashboard panel, the XPlainer WooCommerce FAQ manager plugin lets the customer control it from the front-end interface.

To enable this option, follow the steps below:

  1.  Navigate to **XPlainer > Settings** page and then find the Expand/Collapse All option under the General tab.
  2.  At first, enable this feature and then set the **Expand/Collapse All** Label text. This text will work as the button text for the Expand/Collapse All button.
